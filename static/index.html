    <p class="sec-title" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 50px;"><strong>Opium Games: What's it all about?</strong></p>
    <p class="sec-desc" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;"><strong>Opium Games</strong> is <b>Your</b> go-to unblocked game website with the intention of giving everyone unblocked games for School, Work, and in general. Along with a built in UV proxy, and more. We hope you enjoy our most ambitious project! As we will appreciate your feedback.</p>
    <p class="sec-title" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 50px;"><strong>Who made Opium Games</strong></p>
    <p class="sec-desc" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">The founder and creator behind <strong>Opium Games</strong> is <a href="https://github.com/MyBooty165">X-88</a>, along with <a href="https://github.com/sc0ttferren">SC0TT</a> who is a Co-Owner and contributor of <strong>Opium Games</strong>. This project is under the ownership of <a href="https://cybriatech.dev">CybriaTech</a> and will remain under <strong>CybriaTech</strong> ownership.</p>
    <p class="sec-title" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 50px;"><strong>History behind Opium Games</strong></p>
    <p class="sec-desc" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;"><strong>Opium Games</strong>, formerly CybriaGames (now discontinued), began on July 15, 2023, during the summer of that year as CybriaTech's first project. It enjoyed significant success, appearing on numerous unblocked link lists and amassing 26 forks. On November 21, 2023, <strong>Opium Games</strong> emerged as the planned successor to CybriaGames, introducing features such as Proxy Links, Emulators, Bookmarklets, and Tab Cloakers. It quickly gained popularity within my school district, especially after CybriaGames was blocked. By January 2024, CybriaGames had been removed, allowing <strong>Opium</strong> to establish dominance as the unblocked game website.</p>
    <p class="sec-title" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 50px;"><strong>How do Opium Games earn profit</strong></p>
    <p class="sec-desc" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">We make sure everyone gets to use Opium Games freely, though for us, it is a bit of a hassle trying to pay for domains and even storage. So Opium gets monetized via advertisements from <a href="https://adsense.google.com">Google Adsense</a> and/or donations from <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/cybriatech">Buy Me A Coffee</a>. We hate popup and pop under ads so we make sure those ads never get in the way so that you can enjoy our stock of games!</p>
    <p class="sec-title" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 50px;"><strong>Opium Games is blocked on my device, what do I do?</strong></p>
    <p class="sec-desc" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">No worries, Opium Games has many <strong><a href="/e/m/">mirror</a></strong> links so that anyone can use any link that leads to Opium. We use the <a href="https://cygg.cybriatech.dev">CYGG Proxy</a> to distribute mirrors of Opium Games to apps that support it like <a href="https://render.com">Render</a>, <a href="https://codesandbox.io">Codesandbox</a> and more. Along with <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org">FreeDNS</a> to distrubute unblocked and random Opium Games links.</p>
